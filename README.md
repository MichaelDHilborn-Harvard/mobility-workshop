mobility-workshop
=================

Get your mobility on.

# Setting Up
## Github
Pull down the github.

Don’t worry, the only git commands you’ll need to know for this are:
`git clone <repo>` 
`git checkout <branch>`

If you need git: ...

So now pull down the repo into your workspace with:
`git clone `

now `cd mobility-workshop`
and checkout the first step:
`git checkout step00`

## Node
Now I’m only making you use node to run a localhost so you can avoid any potential cross-site security errors. If you want to do something like python -m SimpleHTTPServer, that’s just as good. But this workshop is all javascripty. So.

Installing Node:
`curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`

`npm install http-server -g`
The -g installs it so it’s globally available.

From the directory you’re in, just type:
`http-server`
